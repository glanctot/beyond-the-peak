# Beyond the Peak

## Description
People want to have fun. When they get together with friends, they want to try new things and experience sometimes zany, random fun. With this in mind, we created an app designed to give people a simple way to experience a carefree, sometimes crazy, time out with their friends.

Full stack application that automatically generates a random cocktail.  Drinks are randomly pull from the Cocktail DB API and displayed to the screen.  If you do not want that drink you can click the "try something different" button to get another cocktail.  Depending on your mood, you can get a little daring and click the bottle button to intensify your night.  The bottle button will display random ingredient to be added to your cocktail.  After you have had the drink, click the "down the hatch" button and that drink will be saved to local storage.  Check the "Morning After Results" page to review your evening and recall the memories you thought you would never recover.  A Singup and Login page is available for those that want to leave reviews on the Comments page.
